# pomodoro
For my Pomodoro Timer project, I created a straightforward yet effective tool to help with time management, based on the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro method focuses on breaking work into 25-minute intervals, called "Pomodoros," followed by short breaks. This concept has always helped me stay on track, so I decided to build a web application that allows users to track their work and break cycles seamlessly.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the app. The idea was to make it as interactive and user-friendly as possible, so you can quickly start your timer and focus without distractions. When you open the app, youâ€™re greeted with a clean and simple interface that displays a countdown timer in minutes and seconds. The default timer is set to 25 minutes (which is the standard for Pomodoro), but you can customize the duration at the start of the session, in case you want to adjust it for your needs.

Key Features and Functionality:
User Interface:
The timer is displayed prominently at the center of the page with large, readable minute and second values.
A button labeled "Start" initiates the timer, which then toggles between "Start" and "Pause" to allow users to control the countdown.

Timer Mechanism:
Upon activation, the timer counts down from a user-specified duration (defaulting to 25 minutes if not set).
The countdown is displayed in a format of minutes:seconds, updated every second.
Once the time reaches zero, the timer stops, and a bell sound (loaded via an audio element) is played to signal the end of a session.

Break Period:
After completing a Pomodoro session (25 minutes), the timer automatically transitions to a 5-minute break. This is visually indicated by a change in background color and border style, signaling the switch to break time.
A separate "Break Time!" message is displayed, along with the start of the break countdown.

State Management:
The timer state (running, paused, or reset) is tracked using Boolean variables, ensuring accurate control over the timer's behavior.
Event listeners handle the transitions between the states, responding to user interactions with the start/pause button.

Audio Alert:
The "ring.mp3" file is played at both the start and end of each Pomodoro cycle, providing an auditory cue for users to focus or take a break.

Styling:
The interface has a clean, minimalistic design with soft pastel colors and subtle shadows for the timer and buttons, ensuring good readability and user experience. The transition effects (e.g., for background color) add a smooth feel to the interaction.

Timer Customization:
The user can set their own Pomodoro duration by entering a value upon initialization. If an invalid duration is entered, the system defaults to the standard 25 minutes.
